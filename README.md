- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Francesco Greco (@fr-greco), a PhD Student in Translational Medicine at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa;
I am carrying my PhD project at Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza ONLUS in Pisa.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Proteomics and MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging, as well as Fluorescence Microscopy and Multimodal imaging, applied to clinincal samples.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on the region-specific analysis of atherosclerotic plaques, to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic ones.
- I am developing some MATLAB code to merge MALDI MSI data and other imaging platforms, as well as to process and analyze Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy data!
